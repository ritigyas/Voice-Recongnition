# Voice Recognition System

## Overview
This project implements a voice recognition system capable of processing and recognizing speech commands. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze audio input and match it with predefined commands or transcriptions.

## Features
- Real-time speech recognition
- Keyword detection
- Command execution based on recognized speech
- Integration with various applications

## Project Workflow
1. **Audio Input**: The system captures voice input via a microphone.
2. **Preprocessing**: Noise reduction and feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs) are applied.
3. **Model Processing**: A trained machine learning model analyzes the speech input.
4. **Speech Recognition**: The system matches the processed input with predefined commands or transcribes the speech.
5. **Action Execution**: Recognized commands trigger corresponding actions within the application.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
Connects to Google Drive for storage.
Records labeled voice samples using a microphone.
Organizes and stores audio files for training.
2. **Preprocessing**
Loads audio files and extracts MFCC features.
Normalizes data for better training efficiency.
Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets.
3. **Model Training**
Builds a neural network classifier for voice recognition.
Optimized using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
Evaluates performance with accuracy and loss metrics.
4. **Speaker Recognition**
Captures a new voice sample.
Preprocesses the sample and feeds it into the trained model.
Predicts and identifies the speaker.

## How to Use
1. **Start the Application**: Run the script to initialize the voice recognition system.
2. **Speak into the Microphone**: The system will process the input and analyze the speech.
3. **Command Execution**: The system will execute the corresponding action if the input matches a predefined command.
4. **Transcription Mode**: The system will provide a text transcription of the spoken input if enabled.
5. **Integration**: Use the recognized speech output to interact with other applications or services.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- SpeechRecognition Library
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for Model Training
- OpenAI Whisper API (optional for transcription)
- NumPy, Pandas, and Librosa for Audio Processing
